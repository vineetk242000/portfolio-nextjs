  about: `Hey! It's Vineet here.  I am currently in the 3rd year of my Undergrad course at Bengal College of Engineering and Technology, Durgapur. <br />This love and hate kind of relationship with product development started back in 2019  when I was trying to figure out what I'm good at.
    In a short period, I learned a great deal about development and life in general. 20+ Personal Projects later, I got an opportunity to work as a MERN Stack developer in one of the startups where I built an eCommerce website from scratch. <br />
    Apart from these, I am really interested in the tech space. Nothing excites me more than the new tech innovations and gadgets. You can also find me writing Tech Blogs in my spare time. <br />
    And Yeah! Feel free to contact me for any Business or Project related queries. Maybe, I have the solution that you are looking for.`,
